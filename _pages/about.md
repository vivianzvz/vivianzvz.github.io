Welcome! I'm **Vivian Juehui Zheng**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC Santa Cruz.

I use lab experiments and behavioral models to study how people make decisions in markets.  
My research focuses on:
- The role of public vs. private information in shaping asset price volatility
- How auction formats and market structure affect information aggregation
- The impact of UI design on market behavior
