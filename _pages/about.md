Welcome! I'm **Vivian Juehui Zheng**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC Santa Cruz.  
I specialize in behavioral and experimental economics, using laboratory experiments and theory to explore how people make decisions in markets.

My research examines:
- The role of public and private information in shaping asset price volatility and liquidity  
- How market formats (like auctions vs. call markets) affect information aggregation and strategic behavior  
- The impact of user interface design on market efficiency
