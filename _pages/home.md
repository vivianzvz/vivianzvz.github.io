Welcome! I'm **Vivian Juehui Zheng**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC Santa Cruz.

I use lab experiments and behavioral models to study how people make decisions in markets.  
My research explores:
- How public and private information affects asset pricing
- Differences in behavior across market formats
- How visual interfaces impact trading behavior and outcomes
