Welcome to my website! I am Vivian, an experimental and behavioral economist from UC Santa Cruz focused on exploring how human behavior, biases, and decision-making impact the functioning of financial markets and institutions.

With a research focus on unraveling these complexities, I bring insights from both empirical analysis and theoretical frameworks. As an experienced educator, I have served as a teaching assistant across various economics courses and as an instructor specializing in managerial economics and game theory.

I am currently on the job market.
